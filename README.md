# MPI-Parallel-processing-Sorting-
Parallel processing of sorting algorithm using MPI

To distribute resources among various processes in various computers to reduce the processing time for solving huge size data processing.

It was observed that when the program was made to run on 1 process, it used only one core in spite of the fact that the other cores were ideal. So inorder to overcome this we created a simple scheduler has been designed that performs scheduling as well as load balancing at the core level.

NOTE: See the report for details observation and explaination
